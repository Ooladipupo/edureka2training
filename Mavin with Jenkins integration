Steps to follow
	setup Maven on Jenkins server
	set up environment variable
		i.e JAVA_HOME, ME, M2_HOME
	Install mavin plugin
	configure maven and java

1. To start with, google mavin installation on linus, click on mavin.apache.org
2. Download apache mavin by gooogling maven download. we are downloading Binary tar.gz archiv by right clicking to copy the link
  -this link will be installed on our jenkins server (which w already created on AWS and access via SSH USING MOBAXTERM)
  -we have ned to install this in the OPT directory, so we need to change directory to opt with the below command
			# cd /opt
  - used the wget to download the link to our server by
	# wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.0/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.0-bin.tar.gz
3. confirm the presence of the file in the opt directory by doing ll command
4. Next is to extract the dpwnloaded file with the following command
	# tar -xvzf apache-maven-3.9.0-bin.tar.gz
5. confirm the download was successful by doing ll
6. you can change/move the apache-maven-3.9.0 to maven by using the below command
	# mv apache-maven-3.9.0 maven
7. confirm that the move/change of name to maven was successful by doing ll
8. to see the list of directories inside maven, first change directory to maven by (# cd maven), then do ll to list out the directories.
9. YOU WANT TO LIST OUT THE DIRECtories with the bin folder by cirst changing directories (# cd bin), then followed by ll
10. next is to execute the mvn directory by doing
	# ./mvn -v
11. next is to set up the environement variable under the bash profile. to access the bash profile, change directory to root fitst (cd ~), then list out using # ll -a.
	Note that using the ll or ls will not help here. so make sure to use the LL -a commancd
12. we need to edit the .bash profile using or vi/vim editor. then add the following immediately under the fi as below
		fi
		M2_HOME=/opt/maven
		M2=/opt/maven/bin
		JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.16.0.8-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64

  Aalso we need to edit the PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin as PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME:$M2_HOME:$M2

	pLEASE NOTE THAT the above item (/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.16.0.8-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64) is the path of the installed java with you can get using the find command as below
	 (# find / -name jvm). then change directory to the /usr/lib/jvm by using (cd /usr/lib/jvm) which will show the installed java application.
  Alternatively, you can get the directory path of the java by typing the below command # find / -name java-11* . and copy the path to be pasted on the bash editor above.
13. To load the modification we can relogin in back to our root account or simply do the below source command as (# source .bash_profile) will load the load the bash again. you will see the java path, maven path
14. YOU CAN CONFIRM THE updathed bath by doing (echo $PATH). you can do this before point 13 above to see the changes.
15. now you should be able to execute maven from anywhere. try this with (# mvn -v)
16. we need to tell jenkins the location of out java and maven. but to go about this, we need to install maven plugin on jenkins first
17. install the maven plugin on jenkins
18. go to clogal tool configuration to add java path and maven path on jenkins.
	java path is /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.16.0.8-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64

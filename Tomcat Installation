- to find a file in the tomcat directory, eg say for example you are looking for the context.xml file, just go to the tomcat directory and search with this command
		# find / -name context.xml

- to shutdown tomcat sever, find your way in to the bin directory within the tomcat directory and do  # ./shutdown.sh. to start back the tomcat service, simply do # ./startup.sh
